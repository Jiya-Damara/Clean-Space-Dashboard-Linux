With the increasing reliance on digital systems, users frequently encounter cluttered directories, inefficient file organization, and lack of visibility into their systemâ€™s disk usage. While graphical file managers exist, they are often resource-heavy and may not be suitable for low-resource or server environments where command-line tools dominate. Moreover, keeping track of storage thresholds and system performance requires familiarity with multiple CLI utilities, which can be daunting for non-technical users.
This project was motivated by the need to simplify and centralize these essential files and disk management tasks into one cohesive tool. By leveraging the power of Bash scripting and the dialog utility, the File Management System provides a lightweight, interactive, and intuitive interface that makes it easy to organize files, monitor storage, and access system stats without needing deep knowledge of Linux internals. This tool not only promotes better system hygiene but also demonstrates how shell scripting can be used to solve real-world problems with minimal dependencies.
